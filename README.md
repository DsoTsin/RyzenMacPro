# Ryzen Mac Pro - OpenCore EFI for ASRock X570 ITX



This repository provides the basic EFI folder to run macOS Catalina on an ASRock Phantom Gaming ITX/TB3 motherboard. The default provided currently using a Ryzen 9 3900X 12 Core CPU and a Radeon RX 5500 XT. For a short guide to using different CPUs and GPUs see below (all kexts specific to those are named explicitely).

## Ryzen Mac Pro build

**Prozessor:** AMD Ryzen 9 3900X  
**Mainboard:** AsRock X570 Phantom Gaming ITX/TB3 (BIOS 2.0)  
**Memory:** Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro (2x, 16GB) DDR4-3200  
**Storage:** Corsair MP600 (1000GB) M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0  
**Video Card:** Sapphire Radeon RX 5500 XT Pulse 8G  
**Power Supply:** Corsair SF600 Platinum

## Content

### ACPI

The following SSDT files are for setting up AGPM injector, HDET and EC.

- SSDT-EC.aml
- SSDT-HPET.aml
- SSDT-PLUG.aml
- SSDT-SBRG.aml
- SSDT-XOSI.aml (requires the "_OSI to XOSI" patch)

The following SSDT files are for USB Power and properly name USB controllers and ports. Note: to fix sleep issues the internal HS10 port connected to bluetooth is **not** configured as internal. Currently also the internal USB 2 header is not mapped (the SSDT-XHC-full.aml contains all even unconnected ports to do a custom mapping).

- SSDT-USBX.aml
- SSDT-XHC.aml

### Kexts

Besides the default kexts the following are noteworthy:

For enabling the integrated Intel Bluetooth

- IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext
- IntelBluetoothInjector.kext

The SMCAMDProcessor.kext is used to provide CPU temperature and frequency information, the AMD Power Gadget can be downloaded from https://github.com/trulyspinach/SMCAMDProcessor/releases. Other monitoring tools can also access and display this information.

The VoodooTSCSyncAMD kext is used to sync the cores and required the correct number of threads (cores * 2). Either update the Info.plist of the kext or download the generator from [insanelymac](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/744-voodootscsync-configurator/).

The AGPMInjector kext is used to inject proper power management and can be generated by Pavo's [AGPMInjector](https://github.com/Pavo-IM/AGPMInjector/releases) app for your SMBIOS and GPU model.

The AMD-USB-Map kext is depending on the SMBIOS and can be created with the  [Hackintool](https://www.hackintosh-forum.de/forum/thread/38316-hackintool-ehemals-intel-fb-patcher/).



## Setup

### BIOS settings

Everything is tested with ASRocks latest BIOS v2.0:

- CSM: disabled
- Above 4G decoding: disabled (must be enabled for certain older graphics card)
- Thunderbolt: enabled
  - Security Level: No Security
- Fast boot: disabled



## Known issues

Thunderbolt controller is not detected by MacOS unless device is already connected during boot. Hot plug does not work and changing devices requires a reboot.

Wakup from sleep ends in a reboot.

The integrated Intel Wifi is not yet supported.
